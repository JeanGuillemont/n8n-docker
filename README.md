# n8n-docker

A version of [n8n](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n) to be deployed on render.com free tier with [supabase](http://supabase.com/) as database, inspired from work of [crazy-max](https://github.com/crazy-max/docker-n8n) and modified in order to install the last version with updated dependencies.

n8n is an extendable workflow automation tool. With a fair-code distribution model, n8n will always have visible source code, be available to self-host, and allow you to add your own custom functions, logic and apps. n8n's node-based approach makes it highly versatile, enabling you to connect anything to everything.

Feel free to fork and improve !
